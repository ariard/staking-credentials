Staking Credentials
===================

This is an in-progress implementation of the [Staking Credentials](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-November/003754.html) to mitigate counterparty risk in Bitcoin financial contracts or to redeem services
from a paid Nostr relay (e.g a CivKit functionary node).

The module aims in priority to be compatible with the Lightning Dev Kit architecture, while progressively extending support to other Lightning softwares.
